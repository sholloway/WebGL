Trying to understand how to utilize the OpenGL 3+ pipeline for doing 2D graphics.
To simplify things a bit, trying to use WebGL.

Design:
Jitterbug's design will have to be more complicated to deal with layers, multithreading, geometry, colors...
However, the 2D api should be relatively the same. It would be nice to have the same concept of a sketch that 
can be written atomically and without knowledge of OpenGL and it's hassles.
